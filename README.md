# NASA-Space-EDA
NASA Space Exploration Data Analysis repository

In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of space exploration, specifically focusing on the Apollo and upcoming Artemis missions. As a data scientist, I have explored and analyzed various datasets to gain insights into crucial aspects of these missions.

# Overview

Space exploration involves meticulous planning, and understanding every detail, especially when it comes to weight considerations on a rocket. This project highlights the significance of data science skills and practices in providing valuable insights for decision-making in space missions.

# Key Objectives

   1)   Moon Sample Analysis:
        Gathered information about samples brought back from the Moon via the Apollo missions.
        Explored and analyzed data related to Moon samples, unraveling valuable information.

   2)   Spacecraft and Rockets Data:
        Acquired data about the types of spacecraft and rockets used for the Apollo and upcoming Artemis missions.
        Compiled DataFrames, or tables, to facilitate storytelling and provide insights into mission components.

   3)   Weight Prediction for Artemis Missions:
        Utilized data-wrangling skills to create a prediction model for the amount of sample weight that could be returned from the Artemis missions.

    4)  Rock Recommendation for Artemis Astronauts:
        Made recommendations for the amount and types of rocks Artemis astronauts should focus on, based on current research on Earth.

# Data Exploration and Insights

The compiled DataFrames tell compelling stories, providing a comprehensive view of the data. The analysis extends beyond the specifics of space exploration, demonstrating the versatility of data science skills across various industries.
